# Odin Recipes Project

This recipe website was created in order to practice the html skills learned in the Odin Project HTML Foundations course.
It includes an index which links to several individual recipe pages stored in their own recipes directory.
Each recipe page includes an image, several headings, and lists both ordered and unordered.
Note that all initial pages were added in one commit. This was not according to best practice and smaller commits should be made in the future.
